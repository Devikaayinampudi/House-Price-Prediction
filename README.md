# House-Price-Prediction
House Price Prediction is a Machine Learning project that predicts the price of a house based on various features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other property-related factors.  The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices accurately using historical housing data.
